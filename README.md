# My Open Source projects

I'm [Robin van Baalen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinvanbaalen/), a seasoned software developer 
and business owner, I have a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems and 
create innovative solutions. With over a decade of experience in the industry, I have 
worked with a variety of companies and have developed a strong skill set in a range 
of programming languages and frameworks. 

This is a list to some of my open source projects ü§ìüçï

## Standalone projects

### Cura√ßao Election 2025
![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rvanbaalen/curacao-election-2025)

Elections are coming up in Cura√ßao and I felt that there was a lack of information about the political parties and their
programs. I used ChatGPT Deep Research to summarize the information about this election's political parties and created
a multi-lingual website to present this information.

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/runner-manager)

Easily control GitHub self-hosted runners locally with the runner-manager command-line interface.
I wanted a tool to add, remove, start and stop Github self-hosted runners on my machines without
manually copying and pasting all the commands every time. This simple CLI does exactly that. 

All it takes is one simple npx command to get started:

```bash
npx runner-manager
```

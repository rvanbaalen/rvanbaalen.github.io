# My public projects

## NPM packages
Reusable functionalities, most of the times without any external dependencies,
are the core concept of most of my open source packages. These are often
utilities I use in my real-life projects.

## CLI tools

Easily control GitHub self-hosted runners locally with the runner-manager command-line interface.
I wanted a tool to add, remove, start and stop Github self-hosted runners on my machines without
manually copying and pasting all the commands every time. This simple CLI does exactly that. 

All it takes is one simple npx command to get started:

```bash
npx runner-manager
```
